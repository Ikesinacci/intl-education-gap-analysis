Bridging Expectations and Realities: Nigerian Students in International Education
This project analyzes survey data from the TINE Africa Summit 2024, exploring the gap between aspirations and lived realities of Nigerian students pursuing international education. By combining Python-based statistical analysis and an interactive Power BI dashboard, the project highlights critical discrepancies in motivations, finances, cultural integration, and career outcomes.

Python Analysis Notebook

File: NAVIGATING_THE_ASPIRATIONS_AND_REALITIES.ipynb
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how survey data was processed, analyzed, and visualized using Python.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Structured and normalized survey responses.
EDA: Summary stats and distributions of motivations, expectations, and outcomes.
Comparative Analysis: Quantified expectation–reality gaps across finance, culture, academics, and careers.
Visualization: Charts built with matplotlib and seaborn for clear communication of insights.

Recommendations: Evidence-backed insights to inform policy and institutional support.

Tools & Libraries:
Python 3.x
pandas, numpy
matplotlib, seaborn

Power BI Dashboard

File: beyond_borders_TINE.pbix

An interactive dashboard that visualizes the expectation–reality gap, making findings more intuitive for non-technical stakeholders.

Key Features
Motivations analysis (career, academics, culture).
Financial expectations vs. realities (scholarships, part-time work, actual costs).
Cultural & academic integration insights.
Career outcomes post-study.

Visual indicators highlighting critical mismatches.

Usage
Download the .pbix file.
Open in Power BI Desktop (free from Microsoft).
Interact with slicers, filters, and visuals to explore findings.

Insights
The combined analyses revealed:
Financial strain is far greater than anticipated (limited scholarships, visa restrictions, high costs).
Cultural adaptation challenges often outweigh optimistic expectations.
Career reintegration into Nigeria is less straightforward than expected.
Support gaps exist in academic systems and student services abroad.

Why This Project Matters:
This project demonstrates how data science + BI visualization can work together to uncover actionable insights from survey data. It blends statistical rigor (Python) with data storytelling (Power BI) to create a holistic understanding of Nigerian students’ experiences abroad.

Next Steps:
Expand dataset with longitudinal or cross-country comparisons.
Develop predictive models to forecast likelihood of expectation
Deploy interactive dashboards online for broader accessibility.
